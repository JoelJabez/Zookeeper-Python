<h2>Overview of the basic program</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In this topic, you will learn how to develop your first Python programs. Even though these programs are quite simple, they are still syntactically correct and show that programming in Python is a treat.</p><h5 id="the-hello-world-program">The Hello World program</h5><p><video controls="" src="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262927/720/b08bde3b9ec2400accac0508c9a51c59.mp4"> Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262927/720/b08bde3b9ec2400accac0508c9a51c59.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player! </video></p><p>Our first example will be <strong>Hello, World!</strong> It is traditionally used to introduce beginners to a new programming language.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello, World!")</code></pre><p>As you can see, this program consists of a single line. It prints the string passed in parentheses but without quotes. You may run this code online. To that end, copy the code to <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this website</a> and click on the triangle. Alternatively, follow these <a href="https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/#installing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">installation tips</a>. You should get this result:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello, World!</code></pre><p>Although this code is very simple, we will thoroughly review it.</p><h5 id="short-explanation">Short explanation</h5><p><video controls="" src="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262928/720/37cbebcba7ddcb41339f92744e2be155.mp4"> Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262928/720/37cbebcba7ddcb41339f92744e2be155.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player! </video></p><p><strong>print</strong> is the name of a function. A <strong>function</strong> is a block of code that does useful work for you, e.g., printing text. In a sense, a function is a subprogram that can be reused within your programs. When the name of a function is followed by parentheses, it means the function was <strong>called</strong> to get the result.</p><p>Let's go further: <code class="language-python">"Hello, World!"</code> is a Python string. All strings are surrounded by <em>single</em> or <em>double</em> quotes, so <code class="language-python">'Hello, World!'</code> is also a valid string. You may replace this string with another one, and the program will print the new string. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('Python 3.x')</code></pre><p>As you might guess, this program will print the following:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Python 3.x</code></pre><h5 id="printing-quotes">Printing quotes</h5><p><video controls="" src="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262929/720/34163de0a297699dcde452fd9736f29c.mp4"> Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262929/720/34163de0a297699dcde452fd9736f29c.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player! </video></p><p>Imagine that the string you want to print already contains quotation marks. If you would like to include them into a string, enclose this string in quotes of <strong>another</strong> type, e.g.:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print("Yes, I'm ready to learn Python.")</code></pre><p>The part of the string with <code class="language-python">I'm</code> is printed <strong>correctly</strong> because you used double quotes <code class="language-python">"..."</code> to enclose the whole string:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Yes, I'm ready to learn Python.</code></pre><p>Writing the following is <strong>wrong</strong>:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('Yes, I'm ready to learn Python.')</code></pre><p>Your program won't know where the string starts and ends.</p><p>You can run all examples using the <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> provided earlier. This will help you familiarize yourself with Python.</p><h5 id="possible-errors">Possible errors</h5><p><video controls="" src="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262930/720/492d75577bdc260a9c963716adea7a98.mp4"> Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262930/720/492d75577bdc260a9c963716adea7a98.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player! </video></p><p>Even the simplest lines of code may contain errors. The most common of them are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Putting extra indentation</strong></p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">   print("Hello, World!")</code></pre><p>This statement does not work because of extra spaces before <code class="language-python">print</code>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Calling a function by the wrong name</strong></p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">pint("Hello, World!")</code></pre><p>This line contains <code class="language-python">pint</code> instead of <code class="language-python">print</code>. Make sure to refer to every function by its proper name.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Writing names in the wrong case</strong></p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">PRINT("All caps")</code></pre><p><code class="language-python">Print</code>, <code class="language-python">print</code> and <code class="language-python">PRINT</code> are not the same. Names are case-sensitive in Python.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Missing one or both quotes for a string</strong></p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">print("Python)</code></pre><p>This statement does not work because of missing closing quotes.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Missing one or more parentheses</strong></p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">print("I have no end"</code></pre><p>Be careful with parentheses, especially when calling a function.</p><p>With the above information, you shouldn't have any serious trouble with such programs.</p><h5 id="summary">Summary</h5><p>In this topic, we've written our first program in Python. We broke it down, printed some strings, and looked at the most common errors you may encounter initially.</p>
