<h2>Variables</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>You can use a programming language like Python to do calculations or work with constant values like strings. Is this enough for you, though? When writing real programs, you usually need to <strong>store values</strong> or evaluation results in computer memory.</p><h5 id="what-is-a-variable">What is a variable?</h5><p>A <strong>variable</strong> is a named place where you can store a value to access it later. Imagine a box where you keep something. That's a variable.</p><p>For example, you calculate a result and would like to reuse this result elsewhere. In this case, you can use such a box to save time.</p><p>In general, it's a good practice to give a variable a name that describes its content.</p><h5 id="defining-a-variable-and-assigning-values">Defining a variable and assigning values</h5><p>You can keep almost anything in variables by assigning a value to a named variable with an equal sign. By <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PEP 8</a>, one space before and after the assignment sign is considered good practice.</p><pre><code class="language-python">day_of_week = "Monday"</code></pre><p>Now you have a string value <code class="language-python">"Monday"</code> stored in computer memory. You can retrieve the value by calling the variable name.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(day_of_week)  # Monday</code></pre><p><code class="language-python">day_of_week</code> stores a value of the <code class="language-python">str</code> type.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(type(day_of_week))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;</code></pre><p>You can always assign a new value to a defined variable.</p><pre><code class="language-python">day_of_week = "Tuesday"</code></pre><p>Now, you will retrieve another value:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(day_of_week)  # Tuesday</code></pre><p>It is possible to assign the value of one variable to another variable:</p><pre><code class="language-python">a = 10
b = a  # b is 10</code></pre><p>If you haven't defined a variable within the scope of your code, you'll see an error when you try to use it:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(month_name)  # NameError: name 'month_name' is not defined</code></pre><p>Python allows you to assign values of different types to the same variable. Let's assign the string name of a month to a variable and print its type.</p><pre><code class="language-python">month = "December"
print(type(month))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;</code></pre><p>Now, let's assign the number of this month to the variable and print its type again.</p><pre><code class="language-python">month = 12
print(type(month))  # &lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre><p>This assignment works because Python is a language with <strong>dynamic typing.</strong></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Please, do not overuse dynamic typing! If your code is long, you might forget that you changed the type of a variable. This is a common reason for errors!</p></div><h5 id="naming-rules">Naming rules</h5><p>As mentioned above, each variable has a name that distinguishes it from other variables. There are some rules for naming variables that you should follow:</p><ul><li><p>Names are case-sensitive (<code class="language-python">month</code> is not the same as <code class="language-python">Month</code>).</p></li><li><p>A name begins with a letter or an underscore, followed by letters, digits or underscores (e.g., <code class="language-python">user_name</code>, <code class="language-python">score1</code>, <code class="language-python">_count</code>).</p></li><li><p>A name cannot start with a digit (for example, <code class="language-python">2q</code> is invalid).</p></li><li><p>A name must not be a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">keyword</a>.</p></li></ul><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Do not break these rules; otherwise, your program will not work.</p></div><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>In this topic, we've learned what variables are in Python. We also saw how to define them, assign values to them, and what their naming rules are. Hopefully, this new knowledge will serve you on your way to learning Python! </p>
