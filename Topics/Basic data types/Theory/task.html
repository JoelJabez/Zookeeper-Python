<h2>Basic data types</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Every <strong>data object</strong> (a variable or a constant) has a <strong>type</strong> that describes how to keep it in memory, which operations can be applied to this object and how to execute these operations.</p><p>A real-world analogy of types is given by biological species or any other abstract attribute shared among specific objects. For example, all dogs you've seen have the type <em>dog</em>, but each is an individual object. Thinking about a dog as a type, you can assume some operations are available. For example, a dog can bark.</p><p>In this topic, we will consider a few of the simplest data types commonly used in programming practice.</p><h5 id="strings">Strings</h5><p>Whenever you want to use textual information in your program, you'll have to work with <strong>strings</strong>. In Python, the string type is called <code class="language-python">str</code>. Strings are extremely common and useful. As discussed, string literals may be delimited using either single or double quotes.</p><ul><li><p>Examples of strings in double quotes:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">print("")               # an empty string
print("string")         # one word
print("Hello, world!")  # a sentence</code></pre><ul><li><p>Examples of strings in single quotes:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-python">print('a')                   # a single character
print('1234')                # a sequence of digits
print('Bonjour, le monde!')  # a sentence</code></pre><p>In a real program, a string can represent an email of a person or an organization.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('hello@hyperskill.org')  # print an email</code></pre><p>As you can see, strings are very easy to use!</p><h5 id="numerical-types">Numerical types</h5><p>Numbers are essential for any programmer. You can hardly write any program without numbers, so let's discuss some basic <strong>numerical types</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><code class="language-python">int</code><strong> (signed integers)</strong>. Called integers or ints, they are whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) having no decimal point.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-python">float</code><strong> (floating-point numbers)</strong>. Called floats, they represent real numbers and have a decimal point.</p></li></ul><p>You can start working with a number by just printing it out.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(11)    # prints 11
print(11.0)  # prints 11.0</code></pre><p>Even though <code class="language-python">11</code> and <code class="language-python">11.0</code> are the same number, the former is an integer, and the latter is a float. The simplest way to distinguish them is by the decimal point. Floats have a <strong>decimal point</strong>, and integers don't. Pay attention!</p><p>You can also use negative numbers and zeros:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(0)      # prints 0
print(-5)     # prints -5
print(-1.03)  # prints -1.03</code></pre><p>Integer numbers can count things in the real world, while floating-point numbers are a good choice for statistical and scientific calculations.</p><h5 id="printing-types">Printing types</h5><p>We also have a way to demonstrate the types of different objects: use the <code class="language-python">type()</code> function, which is part of Python.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(type('hello'))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;
print(type("world"))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;

print(type(100))      # &lt;class 'int'&gt;
print(type(-50))      # &lt;class 'int'&gt;

print(type(3.14))     # &lt;class 'float'&gt;
print(type(-0.5))     # &lt;class 'float'&gt;</code></pre><p>As you can see from the examples above, the <code class="language-python">type()</code> function indicates the data type of a passed value after the word <em>class</em>.</p><h5 id="summary">Summary</h5><p>We hope you now have some intuition about data types. You should remember the simplest types, <code class="language-python">str</code>, <code class="language-python">int</code> and <code class="language-python">float</code>, and how to write their literals. In the following topics, we will learn the specific features of each type. If you need to know the type of an object, print it using the <code class="language-python">type()</code> function.</p>
